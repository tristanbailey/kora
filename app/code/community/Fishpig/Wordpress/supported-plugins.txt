This file contains a list of all supported plugins for WordPress Integration.
All the plugins listed below are plugins that require some form of frontend interaction.
Plugins that operate solely on the Admin of WordPress do not need to be supported and should work
just fine.

When we perform our setup service for this extension, we will install these plugins for you.
